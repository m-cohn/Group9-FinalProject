## Run instructions:
1. Make sure you have all the proper libraries installed (you may use requirements.txt)
2. Make sure that you have all the augmented audio data features on your local machine. You may do this in one of two ways:
    - Download the data at https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1-vZL23B2bJwauUFE90_Vm-cO8_Y48xx4?usp=sharing and put it into the project folder
    - Run the "Create Zipped Data" section of run.ipynb (this should take roughly 30 minutes)
3. Run run.ipynb. If you downloaded the data in step two, you may skip the "Create Zipped Data" section
