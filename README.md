Run instructions:
    1. Make sure you have all the proper libraries installed (you may use requirements.txt)
    2. Make sure that you have all the augmented audio data features on your local machine. You may do this in one of two ways:
        * Download the data at https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1-vZL23B2bJwauUFE90_Vm-cO8_Y48xx4?usp=sharing
        * Run both data_formatter_mfcc.ipynb, data_formatter_spectro_augmen.ipynb, data_formatter_spectro.ipynb (this should take roughly 30 minutes)
    3.
